  What started as a local controversy in Salt Lake City has evolved into a full-blown international scandal. IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship fund _ described as ``humanitarian aid'' by Salt Lake officials _ amounted to a ``bribe. '' ``I'm terribly sorry that even Salt Lake City _ by far the best place to hold the winter games _ had to use certain methods in order to get the vote,'' Hodler said. IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch assigned the international body's juridical commission _ which deals with legal and ethical issues _ to investigate. SLOC president Frank Joklik, who arrived in Lausanne Friday, welcomed the IOC investigation. ``I think that's who the matter should be taken up by,'' he told The Associated Press. But he sought to distance himself from the allegations by making a distinction between the actions of the bidding committee and the current organizing committee. '' U.S. Olympic Committee deputy secretary general John Krimsky described the controversy as ``disruptive'' for Salt Lake's image and preparations for the games.
