summary: 
  Amid a flurry of last minute preparations, the young Palestinian Authority prepared Thursday for a milestone on the road to maturity: its very own airport. As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, Israeli and Palestinian officials were to sign a protocol for the airport Friday and Palestinian negotiators said Gaza International Airport would open Sunday. Officials said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may travel by car to Egypt in order to fly into the airport. ``It may be a landing site for President Clinton, but we're not confirming,'' said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

 As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, Israeli and Palestinian officials were to sign a protocol for the airport Friday and Palestinian negotiators said Gaza International Airport would open Sunday. Israel, which will oversee security at the airport, has forbidden its own citizens from using the airport initially, Israel's Channel 2 TV said. After touring the airport Thursday, a U.S. official said more work needed to be done before the airport was ready for Clinton. The airport will be the first unfettered access route Palestinians will have out of the Gaza Strip.
