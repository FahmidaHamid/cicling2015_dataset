summary: 
  A day after winning the Nobel Prize for literature, Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago insisted that while he was delighted to win the award, it could just as easily have gone to many other Portuguese writers. ``I'm not the only one who deserved it'', said the first Portuguese-language author to obtain the prestigious award. The two leading dailies, Publico and Diario de Noticias, gave over their entire front pages to Saramago. Saramago was born into a poor, illiterate family in Azinhaga, a small town near Lisbon. '' His first novel, published in 1947 _ ``Terra do Pecado,'' or ``Country of Sin'' _ was a tale of peasants in moral crisis. For the next 18 years, Saramago, a communist who opposed the 41-year conservative dictatorship of Antonio Salazar, published only a few travel and poetry books while he worked as a journalist.

The news left the 75-year-old writer no choice but to leave the airport and return to the city's book fair to meet the press and public. ``At that moment I was over the moon and returning to the book fair the only thing I was worried about was that the whole thing was an error,'' said Saramago. '' ``The Vatican is easily upset'', said Saramago, ``I think that the Vatican should keep its mind on its prayers and leave people alone''. ``Nothing in my life would have led one to think I'd win the Nobel Prize'', said Saramago. Regarding the future, Saramago said the book he is currently working on will be called ``The Cavern'' and deals with a modern version of myth of Plato and the cave.
