summary: 
  The chances for a new, strictly secular government in Turkey faded Wednesday when a potential coalition partner insisted on giving the Islamic party a share of power. But Mrs. Ciller said Wednesday she would not join forces with Yilmaz, whose government collapsed Nov. 25 over a mafia scandal. It was not clear what Ecevit's next move would be. Demirel could then choose any member of parliament to head the government until elections in April.

 Ecevit already has the support of her arch-rival, outgoing Premier Mesut Yilmaz, head of the other center-right party. But Mrs. Ciller said Wednesday she would not join forces with Yilmaz, whose government collapsed Nov. 25 over a mafia scandal. We will support him, but only if all parties represented in Parliament are included,'' Mrs. Ciller said. He might also admit defeat and return the task of forming the government to President Suleyman Demirel.
