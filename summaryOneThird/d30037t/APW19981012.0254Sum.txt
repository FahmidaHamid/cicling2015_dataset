summary: 
 Monday was a Jewish holiday and there was no immediate Israeli comment on summit prospects. Erekat said the Palestinians hope the four-day summit, set to begin Thursday outside the U.S. capital, would mark the end of a long round of meetings and the start of implementation of accords. At the table is a U.S plan for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent from the West Bank. The Palestinians accepted the plan, which includes security conditions they must fulfill. 

 anti-summary: 
  A senior Palestinian negotiator says the success of a peace summit this week near Washington depends on a clear-cut ``yes'' from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to an American initiative. ``It is time to deliver,'' Saeb Erekat told reporters Sunday night after a meeting of the Palestinian Cabinet. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan in Amman Monday to brief him on talks with U.S. officials on breaking the deadlock in the negotiations with Israel. Palestinians also were expressing growing unease over the naming of hawkish former Israeli general Ariel Sharon as Netanyahu's foreign minister.

 ``It is time to deliver,'' Saeb Erekat told reporters Sunday night after a meeting of the Palestinian Cabinet. Previously, the Palestinian leadership had said the appointment was an internal Israeli affair. Monday was a Jewish holiday and there was no immediate Israeli comment on summit prospects. However, the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot said over the weekend that Netanyahu's hard-line Cabinet, due to meet Tuesday, was balking at agreeing to an American-authored plan for an Israeli pullback in the West Bank.
