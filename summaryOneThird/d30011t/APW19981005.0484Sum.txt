summary: 
  A key witness in the government's sexual misconduct case against Malaysia's former deputy prime minister remains determined to appeal his conviction, his attorney said Monday. Munawar Ahmad Aness, a friend and speech writer of Anwar Ibrahim, pleaded guilty to the charges last month, allegedly confessing to having sex with the political dissident. Anwar has said the guilty plea was coerced. In a move that could deal a major setback to the case against Anwar, Aness then filed a letter of appeal through his lawyers. Another letter then appeared, saying Aness would not go through with the appeal. His lawyers say the second letter was a fraud. He signed a notice of appeal.
