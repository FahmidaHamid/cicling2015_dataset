  One of four foreigners beheaded by kidnappers in Chechnya claimed in a videotape shown today that he and his fellow hostages were British spies. He refused to answer questions about it, including where or when it was filmed and how or why the government had it. The four men, all wearing heavy beards, looked haggard. Chechen security forces were still searching today for the bodies. Asked about the spying allegation, British Ambassador to Russia Andrew Wood said, ``We don't comment on these things in general but any reasonable analysis would show we have no wish to spy on Chechen territory.
