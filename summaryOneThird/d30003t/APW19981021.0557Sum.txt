  The Spanish and British governments appeared Wednesday to be seeking shelter from the political storm brewing over the possible extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain. ``Despite everything that has been written, this is not a decision for the British government or the Spanish government,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said in an interview published by a Spanish newspaper on Wednesday. In a similar vein, Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman Joaquin Perez said Wednesday: ``The government should not have any opinion about the extradition. '' British police, acting on an international arrest warrant from Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon on Friday, detained the ailing general in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery. The tone of the British Prime Minister's first public comment on the issue contrasted sharply with Sunday's emotional statement from influential Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson who said most Britons would find diplomatic immunity for Pinochet ``gut-wrenching.

Blair added that should Home Secretary Jack Straw would use only strictly legal criteria and act ``as if he were a judge,'' should he be required to make a decision on an extradition request from Spain. '' The European extradition convention gives Garzon 40 days to present a formal extradition request to the British authorities via the Spanish government. A ruling on the appeals is expected next week, and a decision in their favor would nullify Garzon's extradition attempt.
