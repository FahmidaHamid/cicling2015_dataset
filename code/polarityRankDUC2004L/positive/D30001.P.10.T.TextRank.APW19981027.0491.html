<a size="10" name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against anti-government demonstrations.</a>
<a size="10" name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A copy of the resolution has since been submitted to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.</a>
